## Setting up MATLAB

You will need to install [MATLAB](https://mathworks.com/downloads/) or [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) to do this lesson.

If you cannot install either of these, you can use [MATLAB Online](https://matlab.mathworks.com/).
It is free to use, but you need to set up an account.

You will also need to download some data, which we will analyze using MATLAB:

1. Download [matlab-novice-inflammation.zip](data/matlab-novice-inflammation.zip) and move the file to your Desktop.

2. Extract the zip archive. This will create a `matlab-novice-inflammation` directory containing the data files used in the lesson.
