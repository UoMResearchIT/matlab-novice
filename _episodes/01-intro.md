## Introduction to the MATLAB GUI

Before we can start programming, we need to know a little about the MATLAB interface.
Using the default setup, the MATLAB desktop contains several important sections:

* In the **Command Window** we can execute commands.
Commands are typed after the prompt `>>` and are executed immediately after pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
* Alternatively, we can open the **Editor**, write our code and run it all at once.
The advantage of this is that we can save our code and run it again in the same way at a later stage.
* The **Workspace** contains all the variables which we have loaded into memory.
* The **Current Folder** window shows files in the current directory,
  and we can change the current folder using this window.
* **Search Documentation** on the top right of your screen lets you search for functions.
Suggestions for functions that would do what you want to do will pop up.
Clicking on them will open the documentation.
Another way to access the documentation is via the `help` command --- we will return to this later.



## Working with variables

In this lesson we will learn how to manipulate the inflammation dataset with MATLAB.
But before we discuss how to deal with many data points,
we will show how to store a single value on the computer.

We can create a new [variable]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#variable) by assigning a value to it using `=`:
```
>> x = 55
```
{: .language-matlab}
```
x =
    55
```
{: .output}

Notice that matlab responded by printing an output confirming that the variable has the desired value,
and also that the variable appeared in the workspace.

A variable is just a name for a piece of data or *value*.
Variable names must begin with a letter, and are case sensitive.
They can contain also numbers or underscores. Examples of valid variable names are
`weight`, `size3`, `patient_name` or `alive_on_day_3`.

The reason we work with variables is so that we can reuse them, or save them for later use.
We can do operations with these variables. For example, we can do a simple sum:
```
>> y = 10
>> x + y
```
{: .language-matlab}
```
y =
    10
ans =
    65
```
{: .output}

Note that the answer was saved in a new variable called `ans`.
This variable is temporary, and will be overwritten with any new operation we do.
For example, if we now substract y from x we get:
```
>> x - y
```
{: .language-matlab}
```
ans =
    45
```
{: .output}

The result of the sum is now gone forever.
We can of course assign the result of an operation to a new variable, for example:
```
>> z = x * y
```
{: .language-matlab}
```
z =
    550
```
{: .output}

This created a new variable `z`. If you look at the workspace, you can see that the value of z is 550.

We can even use a variable in an operation, and save the value in the same variable. Fer example:
```
>> y = y/5
```
{: .language-matlab}
```
y =
    2
```
{: .output}

Where you can see that the expression to the right of the `=` sign is evaluated *first*,
and the result is then assigned to the variable specified to the left of the `=` sign.

Of course, we can use multiple variables in a single operation, for example:
```
>> z = z - y^3 + 5*x
```
{: .language-matlab}
```
z =
    817
```
{: .output}

where we used the caret symbol `^` to take the third power of y.


### Logical operations

In programming, there is another type of opperation that becomes very important: comparison.
We can compare two numbers (or variables) to see which one is smaller, for example
```
>> c1 = frac < 10
```
{: .language-matlab}
```
c1 =
  logical
   1
```
{: .output}

Something interesting just happened with the variable c1.
If I ask you wether frac (8) is smaller than 10, you would say "yes". Matlab answered with a `logical 1`.
If I ask you wether frac is greater than 10, you would say "no". Matlab answers with a `logical 0`.
```
>> c2 = frac > 10
```
{: .language-matlab}
```
c2 =
  logical
   0
```
{: .output}

There are only two options (yes or no, true or false, 0 or 1),
and so it is "cheaper" for the computer to only save space for those two options.

The "type" of data is not the same as a number.
It comes froma  logical comparison, and so matlab identifies it as such.

You can also see that in the workspace these variables have a tick next to them, instead of the squares we had seen.
There is actually other symbols we can get there, which relate to the types of information we can save (unfold the info below if you want to know more).


> ## Data types
> We mentioned above that we can get other symbols in the workspace which relate to the types of information we can save.
>
> We know we can save numbers, and logical values, but we can also save letters or strings, for example.
> Numbers are by default saved as type [*double*](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/double.html),
> which just means they can store very big or very small numbers.
> Letters are type ['*char*'](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/char.html),
> and words or sentences are ["*strings*"](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/string.html).
> Logical values (or booleans) are values that mean [true](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/true.html)
> or [false](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/false.html), and are represented with zero or one.
> They are usually the result of comparing things.

> >> weight = 64.5
> >> size3 = 'L'
> >> patient_name = "Jane Doe"
> >> alive_on_day_3 = true
> ```
> {: .language-matlab}

> alive_on_day_3 =
>   logical
>    1
> ```

{: .solution}

We can also check if two variables (or even operations) are the same
```
>> c3 = frac == mass/age
```
{: .language-matlab}
```
c3 =
  logical
   1
```
{: .output}

And we can combine comparisons.
For example, we can check wether frac is smaller than 10 ***and*** the age is greater than 5
```
>> c4 = frac < 10 && age > 5
```
{: .language-matlab}
```
c4 =
  logical
   0
```
{: .output}

In this case, both conditions need to be met for the result to be "yes" (1).

If we want a "yes" as long as at least one of the conditions are met,
we woudl ask if frac is smaller than 10 ***or*** the age is greater than 5
```
>> c5 = frac < 10 || age > 5
```
{: .language-matlab}
```
c5 =
  logical
   1
```
{: .output}


> ## Negating conditions and including the limits

> We often asks questions or characterise things in negative.

> Naturally, we may want to do so in programming too.
> In matlab the negative is represented with `~`.
> For example, we can check if the speed is indeed not faster than the limit with `~(speed > 70)`,
> which matlab reads as "not speed greater than 70".

> > ## Solution

{: .challenge}




### Arrays

You may notice that all of the variable types start with a `1x1`.
This is because matlab thinks in terms of *groups* of variables called arrays, or matrices.

We can create an array using square brackets and separating each value with a comma:
```
>> A = [1, 2, 3]
```
{: .language-matlab}
```
A =
     1     2     3
```
{: .output}

If you now hover over the data type icon, you'll find that it shows `1x3`.
This means that the array A has 1 ***row*** and 3 ***columns***.

We can create matrices using semi-colons to separate rows:
```
>> B = [1, 2; 3, 4; 5, 6]
```
{: .language-matlab}
```
B =
     1     2
     3     4
     5     6
```
{: .output}

You'll notice that B has three rows and two columns, which explains the `3x2` we get from the workspace.

We can also create arrays of other types of data. For example, we could create an array of names:
```
>> Names = ["Jhon", "Abigail", "Bertrand", "Lucile"]
```
{: .language-matlab}
```
Names =
  1×4 string array
    "Jhon"    "Abigail"    "Bertrand"    "Lucile"
```
{: .output}

Or we can use logical values too:
```
>> C = [true; false; false; true]
```
{: .language-matlab}
```
C =
  4×1 logical array
   1
   0
   0
   1
```
{: .output}

Something to bear in mind, however, is that all values in an array must be of the same type.

I mentioned before that matlab is actually used to working with arrays rather than individual variables.
Well, if it is so used to them, can we do operations with them?

The answer is of course yes! In fact, this is what makes MATLAB a particularly interesting programming language.

We can, for example, check the whole matrix B and look for values greater than, say, 3.
```
>> B > 3
```
{: .language-matlab}
```
ans =
  3×2 logical array
   0   0
   0   1
   1   1
```
{: .output}

Matlab then compared each element of B and asked "is this element greater than 3?".
The result is another array, of the same size and dimensions as B, with the answers.

We can also do sums, multiplications, and pretty much anything we want with an array, but we need to be careful with what we do.

Despite this being so interesting and increadibly powerful, this course will focus on more basic programming concepts,
and so we will use the feature rather little.
However, it is very important that you keep it in mind, and that you do ask questions about it during the break if you are interested.

> ## Suppressing the output
>
> In general, the output can be a bit redundant (or even annoying!), and it can make the code slower,
> so it is considered good form to always supress it. To supress it, we add a semi-colon at the end of the line:
>
> ```
> >> x = 33;
> ```
> {: .language-matlab}
>
> At first glance nothing appears to have happened, but the workspace shows the new value was assigned.
>
{: .callout}


> ## Printing a variable's value
>
> If we really want to print the variable, then we can simply type its name and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>,
> ```
> >> patient_name
> ```
> {: .language-matlab}
>
> ```
>
> patient_name =
>
>     "Jane Doe"
>
> ```
> {: .output}
>
>  or using the `disp` ***function***.
>
>  Functions are pre-defined algorithms (chunks of code), that can be used multiple times.
>  They usually take some "inputs" inside brackets, and either produce something or output something.
>
>  The [disp](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/disp.html) function, in particular, takes just one input --
>  the variable that you want to print -- and what it does is to print the variable in a nice way.
>  For the variable patient_name, we would use it like this:
>
> ```
> >> disp(patient_name)
> ```
> {: .language-matlab}
>
> ```
> Jane Doe
> ```
> {: .output}
>
> Note how the output is a bit different from what we got when we just typed the variable name.
> There is less indentation and less empty lines.
{: .callout}

> ## Keeping things tidy
>
> We have declared a few variables now, and we might not be using all of them.
> If we want to delete a variable we can do so by typing `clear` and the name of the variable, e.g.:
> ```
> >> clear alive_on_day_3
> ```
> {: .language-matlab}
> You might be able to see it disappear from the workspace.
> If you now try to use alive_on_day_3, matlab will error.
>
> We can also delete **all** our variables with the command `clear`, without any variable names.
> Be careful though, there's no way back!
>
> Another thing you might want to clear every once in a while is the output.
> To do that, we use the command `clc`.
> Again, there is no way back!
{: .callout}
